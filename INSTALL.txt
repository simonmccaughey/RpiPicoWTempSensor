get latest micropython, and install it
Automated install:

make sure the command mpremote is working, and connects to the correct serial port

then run these commands:

mpremote  cp *.py favicon.ico config.json :/
mpremote fs mkdir lib
mpremote  cp modules/*.py :/lib/
##NOTE: connect to network first
mpremote run hints/installation.py
##NOTE: Extra step required because picoweb tries to import ulogging - updated code to use 'logging' instead
mpremote cp ./modules/picoweb/__init__.py :/lib/picoweb/__init__.py


Manual instructions:

follow the instructions in hints/installation.py to install upip packages
copy modules/*.py into device lib folder
copy the remainder of the *.py files from this dir to the device root folder. Also copy config json and favicon file
