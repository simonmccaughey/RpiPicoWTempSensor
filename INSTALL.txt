get latest micropython, and install it on the board 
 - plug board in, shows up as USB drive, then just copy the firmware to the USB drive


make sure the command mpremote is working 
to install:
 - pip install --user mpremote 
 - add the installed location to PATH, 

run mpremote and check it connects to the correct serial port

Automated install:

mpremote  cp *.py favicon.ico config.json :/
mpremote fs mkdir lib
mpremote cp modules/*.py :/lib/

#connect to network first using:
mpremote run hints/network.py

#run automated installation of modules (NOTE: if you get network errors, reboot the device)
mpremote run hints/installation.py

##NOTE: Extra steps required because picoweb tries to import ulogging - updated code to use 'logging' instead
#copy the mip installed file to local
mpremote cp :/lib/picoweb/__init__.py modules/picoweb/
#replace the import with the alias import
sed -i 's/import ulogging/import logging as ulogging/' modules/picoweb/__init__.py
#put the updated file back on the device
mpremote cp ./modules/picoweb/__init__.py :/lib/picoweb/__init__.py



Manual instructions:

follow the instructions in hints/network.py to connect to wifi
follow the instructions in hints/installation.py to install upip packages
copy modules/*.py into device lib folder
copy the remainder of the *.py files from this dir to the device root folder. Also copy config json and favicon file
